Via the "installLocation" attribute of your application you can specify if your application can be installed on the external storage of the device. Use "auto" or "preferExternal" to permit this.

In reality this option is rarely used, as an application installed on the external storage is stopped once the device is connected to a computer and mounted as USB storage.
