RelativeLayout allows positioning the widget relative to each other. This can be used for complex layouts. RelativeLayout is a complex layout manager and should only be used if such a complex layout is required, as it performs a resource intensive calculation to layout its children.

A simple usage for RelativeLayout is if you want to center a single component. Just add one component to the RelativeLayout and set the android:layout_centerInParent attribute to true.
