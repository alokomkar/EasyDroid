An <b>intent</b> contains certain header data, e.g., the desired action, the type, etc. Optionally an <b>intent</b> can also contain additional data based on an instance of the <b>Bundle</b> class which can be retrieved from the <b>intent</b> via the getExtras() method.

You can also add data directly to the <b>Bundle</b> via the overloaded putExtra() methods of the Intent objects. Extras are key/value pairs. The key is always of type String. As value you can use the primitive data types (int, float, …​) plus objects of type String, <b>Bundle, Parcelable and Serializable.</b>

The receiving component can access this information via the getAction() and getData() methods on the Intent object. This Intent object can be retrieved via the getIntent() method.

The component which receives the <b>intent</b> can use the getIntent().getExtras() method call to get the extra data. That is demonstrated in the next code snippet.
