The package attribute defines the base package for the Java objects referred to in this file. If a Java object lies within a different package, it must be declared with the full qualified package name.

Google Play requires that every Android application uses its own unique package name. Therefore it is a good habit to use your reverse domain name here. This will avoid collisions with other Android applications.

<b>"android:versionName"</b> and <b>"android:versionCode"</b> specify the version of your application. <b>"versionName"</b> is what the user sees and can be any string.

<b>"versionCode"</b> must be an integer. The Android Market determines whether it should perform an update of the applications for the existing installation based on that versionCode. You typically start with <b>"1"</b> and increase this value by one if you roll-out a new version of your application.
