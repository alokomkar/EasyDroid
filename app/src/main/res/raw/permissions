The Android manifest file must also contain the required permissions for the application.
<b>For example</b>, if the application requires network access, it must be specified here.

Your application can declare permissions with the <b><permission></b> tag and declare that it required a permission with the <b><uses-permission></b> tag.

Certain permissions, like network access, are granted automatically on Android 6.0 or higher systems. Other permissions must be confirmed by the users to become active.
