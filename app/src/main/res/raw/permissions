The Android manifest file must also contain the required permissions for the application. For example, if the application requires network access, it must be specified here.

Your application can declare permissions with the <permission> tag and declare that it required a permission with the <uses-permission> tag.

Certain permissions, like network access, are granted automatically on Android 6.0 or higher systems. Other permissions must be confirmed by the users to become active.
