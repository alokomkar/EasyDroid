Android supports explicit and implicit intents. An application can define the target component directly in the intent (explicit intent) or ask the Android system to evaluate registered components based on the intent data(implicit intents).

Explicit intents explicitly define the component which should be called by the Android system, by using the Java class as identifier. Explicit intents are typically used within an application as the classes in an application are controlled by the application developer. The following shows how to create an explicit intent and send it to the Android system to start an activity.

Implicit intents specify the action which should be performed and optionally data which provides content for the action. If an implicit intent is sent to the Android system, it searches for all components which are registered for the specific action and the fitting data type. If only one component is found, Android starts this component directly. If several components are identified by the Android system, the user will get a selection dialog and can decide which component should be used for the intent.
