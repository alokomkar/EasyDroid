The user interface of activities is defined with fragments, views and layout managers. These elements are typically defined via an XML layout file.

Views are user interface widgets, e.g., buttons or text fields. Views have attributes which can be used to configure their appearance and behavior.

Layout managers (ViewGroup) are responsible for arranging other views.

Fragments are components which run in the context of an activity. A fragment encapsulates application logic and layout information. It is therefore easier to reuse them and to support devices of different size. For example, a smaller screen shows only one fragment with the option to navigate to the next screen. On a larger screen it shows two fragments.
