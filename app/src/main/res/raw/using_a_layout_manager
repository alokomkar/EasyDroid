A layout manager is responsible for the layout of itself and its child views.
The base class for these layout managers is the <b>android.view.ViewGroup</b> class which extends the <b>android.view.View</b> class.

Android supports different default layout managers. Layout managers can be nested to create complex layouts.

The most relevant layout managers in Android are:

<b>1. ConstraintLayout - provided by an extra library</b>

<b>2. LinearLayout</b>

<b>3. FrameLayout</b>

<b>4. RelativeLayout</b>

<b>5. GridLayout</b>
