A <b>fragment</b> is an independent Android component which can be used by an activity. A <b>fragment</b> encapsulates functionality so that it is easier to reuse within activities and layouts.

A <b>fragment</b> runs in the context of an activity, but has its own life cycle and typically its own user interface. It is also possible to define <b>fragments</b> without an user interface, i.e., headless <b>fragments</b>.

Android devices exists in a variety of screen sizes and densities. <b>Fragments</b> simplify the reuse of components in different layouts and their logic. You can build single-pane layouts for handsets (phones) and multi-pane layouts for tablets. You can also use <b>fragments</b> also to support different layout for landscape and portrait orientation on a smartphone.

As it is possible to dynamically add and remove <b>fragments</b> from an activity. The usage of <b>fragments</b> allows to design very flexible user interfaces.

The typical example is a list of items in an activity. On a tablet you see the details immediately on the same screen on the right hand side if you click on item. On a smartphone you jump to a new detail screen. This is depicted in the next graphic.

The following discussion will assume that you have two <b>fragment</b> (main and detail), but you can also have more. We will also have one main activity and one detailed activity. On a tablet the main activity contains both <b>fragment</b> in its layout, on a handheld it only contains the main <b>fragment</b>.

The next screenshots demonstrates this usage.
