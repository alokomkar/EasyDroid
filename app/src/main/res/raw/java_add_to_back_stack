// Before you call commit(), however, you might want to call addToBackStack(),
// in order to add the transaction to a back stack of fragment transactions.
// This back stack is managed by the activity and allows the user to return
// to the previous fragment state, by pressing the Back button.

// For example, here's how you can replace one fragment with another, and preserve the previous state in the back stack:

// Create new fragment and transaction
Fragment newFragment = new ExampleFragment();
FragmentTransaction transaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction();

// Replace whatever is in the fragment_container view with this fragment,
// and add the transaction to the back stack
transaction.replace(R.id.fragment_container, newFragment);
transaction.addToBackStack(null);

// Commit the transaction
transaction.commit();

// In this example, newFragment replaces whatever fragment (if any)
// is currently in the layout container identified by the R.id.fragment_container ID.
// By calling addToBackStack(), the replace transaction is saved to the back stack
// so the user can reverse the transaction and bring back the previous
// fragment by pressing the Back button.
