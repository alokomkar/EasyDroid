//For example, you may initialize the camera as follows:

@Override
public void onResume() {
    super.onResume();  // Always call the superclass method first


    // Get the Camera instance as the activity achieves full user focus
    if (mCamera == null) {
        initializeCamera(); // Local method to handle camera init
    }
}
