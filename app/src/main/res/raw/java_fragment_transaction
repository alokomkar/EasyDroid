//You can acquire an instance of FragmentTransaction from the FragmentManager like this:

FragmentManager fragmentManager = getFragmentManager();
FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();

// Each transaction is a set of changes that you want to perform at the same time.
// You can set up all the changes you want to perform for a given transaction using methods such as
// add(), remove(), and replace(). Then, to apply the transaction to
// the activity, you must call commit().
