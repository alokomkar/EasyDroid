The uses-sdk section in the manifest allows you to specify the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion version of your application.

1. minSdkVersion
Define the minimum version of Android your application works on. This attribute is used as a filter in applications stores Play. A user cannot install your application on a device with a lower API level than specified in this attribute.

2. targetSdkVersion
Specifies the version on which you tested and developed. If it is not equal to the API version of the Android device, the Android system might apply forward- or backward-compatibility changes. It is good practice to always set this to the latest Android API version to take advantages of changes in the latest Android improvements.
