The <b>uses-sdk</b> section in the manifest allows you to specify the <i>minSdkVersion</i> and <i>targetSdkVersion</i> version of your application.

<b>1. minSdkVersion</b>
Define the minimum version of Android your application works on. This attribute is used as a filter in applications stores Play. A user cannot install your application on a device with a lower API level than specified in this attribute.

<b>2. targetSdkVersion</b>
Specifies the version on which you tested and developed. If it is not equal to the API version of the Android device, the Android system might apply forward- or backward-compatibility changes. It is good practice to always set this to the latest Android API version to take advantages of changes in the latest Android improvements.
